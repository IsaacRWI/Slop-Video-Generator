# Slop-Media-Generator  

## Preliminary Project Overview
After discovering long-term exposure to low quality content is effective to a degree at lobotomising people, social media 
platforms have started massively pushing this *slop* to users world-wide. Effectively keeping the people brain-dead 
whilst raking in money with advertisements and other less than legal practices.  
Now I am not immune to this and have spent a significant portion of my life scrolling away on my phone, and since I can't 
get back the years wasted I might as well put my knowledge on low quality internet slop to use.  
I could start editing these videos manually, but I have better things to do, so I'll be starting this project to see how 
much of this mind-numbing ordeal I can automate. Starting by scraping trending posts on twitter, compositing the video with
moviepy, finding trending music on different platforms, and ending it by uploading it automatically to a couple different 
platforms and maybe do some optimising or smth.
