# Slop-Media-Generator  

## Preliminary Project Overview
After discovering long-term exposure to low quality content is effective to a degree at lobotomising people, social media 
platforms have started massively pushing this *slop* to users world-wide. Effectively keeping the people brain-dead 
whilst raking in money with advertisements and other less than legal practices.  
Now I am not immune to this and have spent a significant portion of my life scrolling away on my phone, and since I can't 
get back the years wasted I might as well put my knowledge on low quality internet slop to use.  
I could start editing these videos manually, but I have better things to do, so I'll be starting this project to see how 
much of this mind-numbing ordeal I can automate. Starting by scraping trending posts on twitter, compositing the video with
moviepy, finding trending music on different platforms, and ending it by uploading it automatically to a couple different 
platforms and maybe do some optimising or smth.

## Preliminary Project Outline
Following the format set by LahMemeKing and a couple other slop accounts on Youtube the video will be a short form video, 
with a background video of a ceiling or someone sitting, this will remain unchanged for all future videos to come.   
The focus of the video and the thing that will actually be changing from video to video will be a popular post ripped off 
of twitter or reddit, with the post, a picture and the top voted comment or something.
There will be 2 of these elements per video, either to increase viewer retention as the viewer is reading the posts or to 
increase the chance of a viewer resonating with the video or something its just a format they use.  
The background music of the video will be a trending music on the platform of the day, scraped from the platform and will 
be tagged when the video is posted to *boost variability* üëçüëçüëç  
Then the video will be composited together with moviepy as a 5 second video and automatically uploaded to Youtube, Instagram,
Tik Tok and whichever platform with creator revenue sharing. Multiple times and on multiple accounts to increase exposure.  
After some time and more data, optimisation of processes can be looked into.
